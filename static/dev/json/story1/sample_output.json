He asked his professor, Professor Dumbledore, who told him energy is the ability to do work. \n\nSam was so excited to learn about energy that he decided to go on an adventure to find out more. He flew on his broomstick to the Forbidden Forest and found a magical creature called a Niffler. The Niffler was using its energy to dig for treasure. Sam watched in amazement as the Niffler used its energy to move around and search for shiny objects. \n\nNext, Sam flew to the Quidditch pitch and watched a match. He saw how the players used their energy to fly around the pitch and catch the golden snitch. Sam was amazed at how the players used their energy to move so quickly and with such agility. \n\nFinally, Sam flew back to Hogwarts and realized that energy was everywhere. He understood that energy was the ability to do work and that it was all around him. He was so excited to learn about energy and he couldn't wait to tell his friends.",
