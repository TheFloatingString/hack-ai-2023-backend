One day, she decided to ask her dad about the distances between planets. \n\n\"Dad, how far away is the planet Tatooine?\" she asked. \n\n\"Well, Riley,\" her dad said, \"it's about 4.2 light years away.\" \n\nRiley was confused. \"What's a light year?\" \n\nHer dad smiled. \"A light year is the distance light travels in one year. It's a really long way - about 6 trillion miles!\" \n\nRiley was amazed. \"Wow, that's really far!\" \n\n\"Yes,\" her dad said, \"but it's nothing compared to the distances between galaxies. That's measured in light years, too!\"",

So, when we say that a star or planet is a certain number of light years away, we're talking about that distance. It's a way to measure distances in space because everything is so far apart.",

She thanked her dad for teaching her about light years and she promised to keep learning more about the universe.
