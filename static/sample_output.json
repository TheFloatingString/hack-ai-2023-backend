He asked his teacher, Professor Dumbledore, who told him energy is the ability to do work. Sam was so excited to learn about energy that he decided to try it out for himself. He ran around the castle, zapping objects with his wand and making them move. He even managed to make a broomstick fly! Sam was amazed at how much energy he had and how it could be used to do work. He was so excited that he decided to share his newfound knowledge with his friends. From then on, Sam was known as the wizard with the most energy!",

In the Harry Potter universe, Sam was a young wizard with freckles, glasses, and a talent for being fast. He was curious about what energy was and discovered that it was the force behind everything magical. Sam used his wand to channel his energy and make objects move and even made a broomstick fly. This showed him how much energy he had and how it could be used to do work. So, in simple terms, energy is the force that allows us to get things done.",

They all worked together and made all sorts of things happen with energy. They lifted heavy books, moved chairs from one place to another with the wave of their wands and ran faster than ever. It was one of the happiest moments of Sam's life. He realized that sharing knowledge and helping others discover new things is what makes a great wizard. From that day on, Sam's friends knew that whenever they needed help with energy, they could count on him. Sam felt proud and happy, knowing that he had made a positive impact in his friends' lives.",
